## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
Blockops Network is on a mission to enhance the web3 experience for developers and startups by making it extremely easy and cost-effective for anyone to set up, maintain, and monitor their blockchain node infrastructure.

Our proposal includes the introduction of a one-click setup feature for bootstrapping parachains and out-of-the-box observability dashboard for all Nodes, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the development process within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Overview

**Why are we building Parachain One-Click Deployment?**

A major hurdle that developers and projects encounter is the complexity involved in setting up, managing and monitoring parachain networks especially when moving beyond basic Single Node Deployments. The conventional process for setting up parachains is time-consuming and requires deep technical knowledge. Components like observability, scalability and reliability of their networks continue to be major concerns for numerous Parachains.

Furthermore, Parachains find it more operationally effective and cheaper to deploy their infrastructure on Dedicated Servers instead of Public Cloud especially for the purpose of performance benchmarking. However, the complexity and cost associated with this endeavor often pose significant challenges to them.

In the current Polkadot network ecosystem, there is an absence of an all-inclusive, hassle-free observability solution tailored to monitor node performance within new and existing chain in the Polkadot Ecosystem

At Blockops Network, we've identified these gaps and are determined to empower developers & startups to easily set up, manage and monitor their node operations on Polkadot.

This application involve:

- The development of Parachain One-Click deployment for networks building on Polkadot chains to easily bootstrap their entire network and deploy their Parachain Networks on Cloud and Dedicated VPS (either self hosted or by Managed Dedciated Server Providers)

- Central Node Observability Dashboard for Parachains and Node Operators in the Polkadot Ecosystem



## Challenges Developers and Startups faces when building dApps
- Complexity: Web3 Infrastructure is intrinsically complex. Developers and startups grapple with several complexities
  - Infrastructure Management: Setting up multi-cloud, multi-region or bare metal environments Infrastructure and ensuring they are updated with new releases is no small feat.
  - Optimization and Planning: From planning node pools, migrating between cloud vendors, to ensuring the chosen solution is secure, cost-effective, and performant, the task-list is endless.
  - Network and Protocol Management: Generating new testnets, validating protocol technologies, and shipping new features require extensive resources.
  - Slashing and Offline Penalties: Blockchain networks penalize nodes for misbehavior or being offline, putting stake assets at risk.
  - Network Collapse: The potential for an entire blockchain network to fail presents a looming risk.
  - It is more effective for parachains to deploy their nodes on Dedicated Servers in addition to helping decentralization, however there is no effective way for anyone to deploy their nodes to Dedicated Servers without having to deal with the complexity of setting up bare metal servers

- Zero Observability Solutions:
  - Thereâ€™s little to no observability solutions for monitoring the state of these nodes to enhance better performance.
  - No Real-Time alerting to pre-emptively alerts Node Operators & Parachains based on the performance & issues on relay or parachains

- Engineering Overheads:
  - The high cost of hiring talented engineers combined with the financial implications of high turnover rates puts additional strain on startups and development projects.
  - Talent Crunch: There's a limited supply of engineers globally, especially those proficient in blockchain and web3 technologies.

- Expensive: Managing all these resources if not properly done can be a financial wormhole for developers and startups

We have developed a one-click deployment feature for Parachains, Node Operators and Networks looking to setup robust Infrastructure on Polkadot.

This platform provides substrate developers with an effortless solution to easily bootstrap their entire network and deploy their Parachain Networks on a public cloud or Dedicated Servers situated within the geographic regions where the Node Providers willing to be provde Dedicated Node Service resides. This ensures that developers and enterprises can build faster and manage parachains easily.

The user interface and infrastructure set up for this project are largely complete and ready. To get a glimpse of the minimum viable product (MVP), you can the [website](https://beta-app.blockops.network/login).

**The System Overview**

The project is composed of three primary open-source modules designed to support node infrastructures:

- coreapi-service:
    Description: Developed using Node.js and TypeScript, this backend service interfaces directly with the node-service. It enables developers and parachain teams to experiment with various chain configurations during the parachain setup phase. The flexibility it provides allows for the selection and testing of different nodes, optimizing for the ideal configurations on the parachain.
    License: Open-source (Apache 2.0)

- ui-service:
    Description: An interface constructed with TypeScript and Next.js, it provides a user-friendly web dashboard that interfaces seamlessly with the coreapi-service. Its features empower users to deploy nodes with ease, giving them an insightful and real-time perspective on crucial metrics related to their nodes, which aids in optimizing node performance.
    License: Open-source (Apache 2.0)

- block-agent (blockops observability agent)
    Description: This agent is dedicated to monitoring and forwarding metrics from individual nodes to a centralized server. Either for parachains or node operators, this component is essential for keeping a pulse on the health and performance of the network and provide resource usage graphs and alerting.
    License: Open-Source (Apache 2.0)

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?:** With the complexity involved in setting up, managing and maintaining parachain networks, this project with enable faster and easier parachain deployment making the technology more accessible and promoting rapid development and also provides dedicated optimized machines for substrate development.


- **Who is your target audience?:** Our target audience are dApps developers looking to bootstrap their parachains network and get started quickly and substrate developers substrate developers looking to build and iterate faster as well as test their smart contracts codes against live networks with Beefy built for purpose dedicated machines.

- **What need(s) does your project meet?:** This project will significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of the development process within the Polkadot ecosystem.

- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?:** OnFinality has been a successful and proven model for only single node deployment. However Onfinality doesn't offer bootstrappable node deployments for parachains. There is currently no out of the box advanced analytics and proactive monitoring to ensure a production grade incident management of networks and nodes. From that perspective, we are a unique solution that combines both services and offers additional interests to our users.

## Development Status :open_book:

Before applying for the Web3 Foundation Grant, the Blockops team has built a DevOps automation for Polkadot and other substrate chains. In our journey so far, we have:

- Launched API Service Beta for Polkadot chains (Polkadot, Kusama and Westend).
- Launched Dedicated Node Service Private Beta.
- Launched Data service for Polkadot Chains.
- Launched MVP for one-click deployment feature for Parachains, Node Operators and Networks looking to setup robust Infrastructure on Polkadot.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

For this proposal we focus on building and streamlining the process of setting up parachains through a one-click setup dashboard. This would dramatically reduce the time and technical expertise required to bootstrap a parachain network, making the technology more accessible to a broader range of users and accelerating the pace of development within the Polkadot ecosystem.
