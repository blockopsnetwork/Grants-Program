# Parachain One-Click Deployment

- **Team Name:** Blockops Network
- **Payment Address:**
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2,

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
Blockops Network is a web3 infrastructure startup with a mission to democratize blockchain node infrastructure making it extremely easy for anyone to build decentralized applications in the Polkadot Ecosystem.

Our application seeks to fund the running costs of developing a parachain one-click deployment mechanism that simplifies the process of building on Polkadot and setting up parachains

### Overview

**Why are we building Parachain One-Click Deployment?**

A major hurdle that developers and projects encounter is the complexity involved in setting up, managing and maintaining parachain networks outside of just creating Single Node Deployments. The conventional process for bootstrapping parachains is time-consuming and requires a high level of technical expertise. Components like observability, scalability and reliability of their networks are still areas that cause a lot of Parachains pains.

Also, substrate developers often lack efficient and responsive build-as-a-service platforms to help them run faster build and test their smart contract codes effectively. Existing platforms often don't provide access to live networks or dedicated machines specifically optimized for blockchain development and testing. This often results in slower iteration times and less reliable smart contract code, creating a gap between development and deployment phases.

At Blockops Network, we've spotted these gaps and weâ€™re set to empower developers & parachains easily setup and manage their nodes operations on Polkadot.

In our journey so far, we have:

- Launched API Service Beta for Polkadot chains (Polkadot, Kusama and Westend)
- Launched Dedicated Node Service Private Beta
- Launched Data service for Polkadot Chains
- Consistently worked towards reducing costs quarter-to-quarter
- Launched MVP for one-click deployment feature for Parachains, Node Operators and Networks looking to setup robust Infrastructure on Polkadot.

Our proposal includes the introduction of a one-click setup feature for bootstrapping parachains and a build-as-a-service platform for Substrate developers, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the development process within the Polkadot ecosystem.

Blockops will provide a one-click setup feature for bootstrapping parachains and a build-as-a-service platform for Substrate developers, with in-depth and flexible configurations in few clicks. This ensures that developers and enterprises can build faster and manage parachains easily.

This project in turn will allow the developers and parachain teams to try multiple chain configurations while setting up the parachains, as well as to choose different nodes to try and test for the best possibilities on the parachain.

This proposal involve:

- The development of Parachain One-Click deployment for networks building on Polkadot chains to easily bootstrap their entire network and deploy their Parachain Networks on our on-demand Spot VPS.

- On-demand Build-as-a-Service Substrate/Polkadot CI process for developers to run quick build, test, and runtime simulations against live blocks with our Beefy onDemand VPS.

- Ongoing cost of maintaining Public RPC Nodes

**Mockups and UI components**

The following are the mockups for high-level application operations, these are subject to change during product iterations.
